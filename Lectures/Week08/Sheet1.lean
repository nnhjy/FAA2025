-- # Q: How to analyze time complexity?
-- We will instrument the code to track the time. However, we do not want to interfere the correctness analysis.
-- We learn an elegant way to do this using Moad
-- # Separation of concerns: the correctness proof and running time proof should not interfere to each other

-- # interpretation in each line
-- If the return type is a monad, say (`List ℕ`), then
-- `let sortedLeft ← mergeSort left`
-- This line means you can treat `sortedLeft` as type List ℕ and let notation tell Lean to put `sortedLeft` into a box
-- If the return type is not a monad, you can use normal `let` with `:=` notation.

## Universal quantifier (∀) and Existential (∃) Quantifiers
* `∀ x : α, P x` means for every element x of type α, the property P x holds.
   In Lean, this is the same as (x : α) → P x
* `∃ x : α, P x` means there exists some element x of type α such that P x holds

  Another usage of `intro` tactic
  * `intro` -- to reduce a goal of the form `∀ x : ℕ , P(x)` to `P(x)` and obtain `x : ℕ` as a variable
    i.e., to prove for-all statement, let fix an arbitrary element x, and then we prove P(x)
    This is because, in Lean, ∀ x : N, P(x) is equivalent to (x :ℕ) →  P(x)

def f (x :ℕ) := x = 0
#check f
example : (∀ x : ℕ, f x) ↔ ((x : ℕ) → f x) := by rfl

example : ∀ n : ℕ, n + 0 = n := by
  intro n
  rfl


/-! tactics for working with the existential quantifier
* `use` -- The use tactic is used to provide a witness for an existential statement: ∃ x, P x
* `obtain` -- The obtain tactic is the reverse of use. When you have a hypothesis that states h : ∃ x, P x, you can use obtain to "extract" the witness x and its property P x from h
           -- so you can use them in your proof.
           -- obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := h extracts witness and property from h: ∃ x, P x
           -- Use obtain ⟨a, ⟨b, c⟩⟩ := h for nested existentials

example : ∃ n : ℕ, n + 3 = 7 := by
  use 4

example : ∃ n m : ℕ, n + m = 5 := by
  use 1,4


-- Definition of an even number.
def IsEven (n : ℤ) : Prop := ∃ k, n = 2 * k

-- If there exists an even number `n` that is greater than 10,
-- then there must exist some integer `m` that is greater than 5.
example (h : ∃ n : ℤ, IsEven n ∧ n > 10) : ∃ m : ℤ, m > 5 := by
  obtain ⟨x,⟨h1,h⟩⟩ := h
  use x
  omega
  -- Use `obtain` to get the number `n` and its properties from `h`.
  -- The syntax is: obtain ⟨n, hn_prop⟩ := h


def IsOdd (n : ℤ) : Prop := ∃ k, n = 2 * k + 1

example (n:ℤ) (h : IsEven n) :  IsOdd (n+1) := by
  rw [IsOdd]
  rw [IsEven] at h
  obtain ⟨k,hk⟩ := h
  use k
  rw [hk]

-- Exercise 0. Prove that the sum of two even numbers is even.
#check Int.mul_add

example (a b:ℤ) (h_a : IsEven a) (h_b : IsEven b) : IsEven (a + b) := by
  rw [IsEven]
  rw [IsEven] at h_a h_b
  obtain ⟨k1,A⟩ := h_a
  obtain ⟨k2,B⟩ := h_b
  use (k1+k2)
  rw [A,B]
  rw [Int.mul_add]

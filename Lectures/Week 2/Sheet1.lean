So far we have seen the following tactics:
- `intro` - introduce hypotheses for implications
- `exact` - provide exact proof terms
- `constructor` - split conjunctions and biconditionals
- `apply` - use implications and functions backwards
- `rw` / `rewrite` - rewrite using equalities
- `unfold` - expand definitions
- `use` - provide witnesses for existentials
- `obtain` - extract components from conjunctions

-- In this week, we will learn more tactics that allows us to prove basic set theory statement.

/-! Set theory

In Lean, a set is always a set of objects of some type.
* If α is a type, then the type Set α consists of sets of elements of α
* For example, the type Set ℕ consists of sets of natural numbers. Given n : ℕ and s : Set ℕ, the expression n ∈ s means n is a member of s
* Two special sets for Set α: ∅ and univ: ∅ is the set having zero elements from α and univ is the set of all elements from α

Basic set operations are built-in.
* s ⊆ t ↔ ∀ x ∈ s, x ∈ t
* s ∪ t ↔ ∀ x, x ∈ s ∨ x ∈ t
* s ∩ t ↔ ∀ x, x ∈ s ∧ x ∈ t

open Set
def S1 : Set (ℕ) := {10}
def S2 : Set (ℕ) := {10,20}


#check S1
#check 10 ∈ S1
#check S1 ⊆ S2

example : S1 ⊆ S2 := by simp only [S1, S2, singleton_subset_iff, mem_insert_iff,
  mem_singleton_iff, Nat.reduceEqDiff, or_false]

-- Remark: FROM NOW ON 'SIMP' IS NOT ALLOWED ---

/-! For technical details
 (1) def Set (α : Type u) := α → Prop. So a set of elements of type α is just a boolean function α → Prop
     saying whether an element belongs.
 (2) Membership is defined as:
     def Set.Mem (x : α) (s : Set α) : Prop := s x
     So x ∈ s is syntactic sugar for s x

example: (10 ∈ S1) = (S1 10) := by rfl

--  (3) How to define an emptyset?
def my_emptyset : Set ℕ := sorry
example: my_emptyset = ∅  := by sorry -- rfl should be enough

--  (4) How to define a universe set?
def my_univ : Set ℕ := fun _ ↦ True
example: my_univ = univ := by sorry


variable {α : Type*}
variable (A B C D: Set α)

example : A ⊆ A := by
  rw [@subset_def]
  intros
  assumption

example : A ⊆ A := by rfl

example : ∅ ⊆ A := by
  rw [subset_def]
  intros
  contradiction

-- running examples
#check mem_inter_iff
example : A ∩ B ⊆ B := by
  intro x h
  rw [mem_inter_iff] at h
  obtain ⟨xA,xB⟩ := h
  exact xB

-- Exercise 1: resolve the sorry
#check subset_def
example : A ⊆ B → B ⊆ C → A ⊆ C := sorry

-- Exercise 2:  More exercises
#check Set.inter_def
example : A ∩ B ⊆ B := by sorry
example : A ⊆ B → A ⊆ C → A ⊆ B ∩ C := by sorry

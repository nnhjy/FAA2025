-- # How does Lean know a function terminate?
-- In many cases, Lean can automatically prove termination.

def Merge: List ℕ → List ℕ → List ℕ
  | x, [] => x
  | [], x => x
  | x::xs, y::ys =>
    if x ≤ y then x :: Merge xs (y::ys)
    else y :: Merge (x :: xs) ys

def ack : Nat → Nat → Nat
  | 0,   y   => y+1
  | x+1, 0   => ack x 1
  | x+1, y+1 => ack x (ack (x+1) y)

/- If Lean cannot deduce the termination (especially, in graph algorithms), we need to supply termination proof.
   We prove termination by showing that the recursion is `well-founded`. That is,
   we specify a `well-founed relation` and prove that each recursive call follows the `decreasing order` of the relation. -/

/- A binary relation `≺` is `well-founded` if it has no infinite descending chains `e₀ ≻ e₁ ≻ e₂ ≻ … `.
   Examples of well-bounded relation:
   1. the less-than relation < on ℕ
   2. the proper subsetr relation ⊊ on the set of finite subsets of ℕ
   Non-examples:
   1. the greater-than relation > on ℕ
   2. the less-than relation < on ℤ

#check WellFounded

/-  Lean has convenient tactics to help us prove termination
 # New tactics for proving termination
 * `termination_by` : Specify a termination measure for recursive functions.
    for example, def f (n : ℕ) : ℕ → ℕ → Prop
   `termination_by a b => myMeasure n a b`
 * `decreasing_by`  : Manually prove that termination measure decreases for each recusrive call.

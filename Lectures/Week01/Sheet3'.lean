-- ## how to define new types from old types
-- Terms can be anonnymous functions (also called λ-expressions)
#check ℕ
#check Nat
-- New types can be created by defining a function between types
#check ℕ → ℕ
#check fun (x : ℕ) ↦ x+10
#check fun (x : ℕ) ↦ (x : ℤ)
#check fun (x : ℕ) ↦ (x^2+x-10: ℤ)

def f' := fun (x : ℕ) ↦ (x^2+x-10: ℤ)

#check ℕ → ℕ → Prop
#check fun x : ℕ ↦ fun y ↦ x = y

def f := fun ( x : ℕ ) ↦ fun ( y : ℕ ) ↦ x = y
#check f
-- function can be partially applied
#check f 0
#check f 0 0

example : f 0 0 := by rfl

/-! New tactics
* `rewrite` [h] - replace a term in the goal with an equivalent term [h].
* `assumption` - we are done because ∃`h` s.t. `exact h` can close the goal
* `rw` -- rewrite, followed by trying to close the goal by rfl.

example (x: ℕ): f 0 x → x = 0 := by
  intro h
  rw [f] at h
  symm at h
  assumption

-- Give a direct proof
example (x: ℕ): f x 1 → x ≠ 2 := by
  intro h
  rewrite [f] at h
  rw [h]
  trivial

example (x y: ℕ): f 0 x ∧ f 0 y → x = y := by
  intro h
  obtain ⟨h1,h2⟩ := h
  rewrite [f] at h1 h2
  rw [← h1,h2]

/-! Bonus:
* `by_contra` - assume the negation of the goal and prove False
* `contradiction` - we are done because we have a proof of `h : P` and `h' : ¬ P`
* `trivial` - apply `rfl` or `assumption` or `contradiction` tactics

-- Prove by contradiction
example (h1: a = b): a = b:= by
  by_contra
  contradiction

example (x: ℕ): f x 1 → x ≠ 2 := by
  contrapose!
  intro h
  rw [h,f]
  trivial

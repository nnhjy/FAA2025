# Function Induction
So far, we have seen induction over ℕ. This week we will cover functional induction.
The core idea is that if a function is recursively defined, then you can prove it recursively as long as you show termination.
On the other hand, functional induction formalizes recursive proofs and tells you exactly what is needed to complete the proof.
These two proofs are equivalent, but they may give you different perspective to think about a problem.

-- In this sheet, we are going to prove the merge lemma

def Merge: List ℕ → List ℕ → List ℕ
  | x, [] => x
  | [], x => x
  | x::xs, y::ys =>
    if x ≤ y then x :: Merge xs (y::ys)
    else y :: Merge (x :: xs) ys

-- Example: Let's prove this by recursion
lemma merge_size_sum (l1 l2 : List ℕ) : (Merge l1 l2).length = l1.length + l2.length  := by
match  l1, l2 with
| x, [] => simp [Merge]
| [], x => unfold Merge; aesop
| x::xs, y::ys =>
  simp +arith +decide only [List.length_cons,Merge]

  · simp
    have: xs.length + ys.length + 1 = (xs.length +1 ) + ys.length := by omega
    rw [this]
    apply merge_size_sum

-- Example: Let's prove this by induction
example (l1 l2 : List ℕ) : (Merge l1 l2).length = l1.length + l2.length  := by

-- Example: another theorem with this hammer
theorem mem_either_merge_auto (xs ys : List ℕ) (z : ℕ)
  (hz : z ∈ Merge xs ys) : z ∈ xs ∨ z ∈ ys := by

-- Let's break down the proof and see how to prove this by ``hand``.
-- Exercise 2.1: try to prove this using either recursion or functional induction (don't use grind on the inductive step)

  (hz : z ∈ Merge xs ys) : z ∈ xs ∨ z ∈ ys := by sorry

-- Exercise 2.2: use mem_either_merge to prove the following.
#check mem_either_merge
theorem min_all_merge (x : ℕ) (xs ys: List ℕ)
 (hxs : x.MinOfList xs) (hys : x.MinOfList ys) : x.MinOfList (Merge xs ys):= by sorry

-- We are ready to prove the main sorted merge.
-- discuss a proof

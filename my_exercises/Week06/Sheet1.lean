-- Divid-and-Conquer + Functional Induction
-- In the recursive algorithms, we always break the problem P(n) into subproblems P(n₁) + P(n₂) of smaller instances
-- The correctness proof is typically based on induction from the smaller instances building up to the larger instance
-- In this lecture, we are going to see how functional induction formalizes this idea

-- Today, we are going to see two examples
-- 1. MergeSort
-- 2. Binary Search
-- The object of this lecture is to formulate the correct intermediate hypothesis so that the functional induction goes through.


-- Merge sort
-- let's use the following version of merge

def Merge: List ℕ → List ℕ → List ℕ
  | x, [] => x
  | [], x => x
  | x::xs, y::ys =>
    if x ≤ y then x :: Merge xs (y::ys)
    else y :: Merge (x :: xs) ys

#check Merge

def list1 := [1,2,10]
def list2 := [3,5,20]

#eval Merge list1 list2

-- Define split list into two halves
-- List.take -- Extracts the first n elements of xs, or the whole list if n is greater than xs.length.
-- List.drop -- Removes the first n elements of the list xs. Returns the empty list if n is greater than the length of the list.
#check List.take
#eval [1,2,3,4,5].take 3
#check List.drop
#eval [1,2,3,4,5].drop 3

-- Merge sort
def MergeSort (x : List ℕ ) : List ℕ  :=
if x.length < 2 then x
else
  let mid := x.length/2
  let l1 := x.take mid
  let l2 := x.drop mid
  let l1' := MergeSort l1
  let l2' := MergeSort l2
  Merge l1' l2'

-- Let's assume sorted_merge for now; we will prove sorted_merge in the next sheet
theorem sorted_merge(l1 l2 : List ℕ)(hxs: Sorted l1) (hys: Sorted l2): Sorted (Merge l1 l2) := by sorry
